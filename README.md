This project involved data cleaning, pivot table creation, and dashboard design for a fictitious company called Samari Packaging Company. The company has two types of workers, Checkers and Packagers, and their work hours were recorded using time_in and time_out data.

The goal of this project was to calculate the number of hours worked each day, the number of packaged items by each Packager, and the number of checked packaged items by each Checker. The project also aimed to calculate the pay for each worker based on their work hours and the number of items produced or checked.

The pay structure for the workers at Samari Packaging Company was as follows: Packagers were paid $0.5 per packaged item while Checkers were paid $0.3 per checked packaged item. Additionally, all workers received a base pay of $5 per hour. A tax of 7% was deducted from the total pay accrued.

The final dashboard displayed key metrics such as total hours worked, total number of packaged and checked items, and total pay earned after taxes. This project aimed to provide insights into the productivity and compensation of the workers at Samari Packaging Company.

### Data Cleaning
Before conducting any analysis, the data had to be cleaned to ensure accuracy. The cleaning process included removing any duplicate entries, handling missing values, and ensuring consistency in the data format.

### Pivot Table Creation
Once the data was cleaned, pivot tables were created to summarize and analyze the data. The pivot tables were used to calculate the number of hours worked each day, the number of packaged items by each Packager, and the number of checked packaged items by each Checker.

### Dashboard Design
To provide a visual representation of the data, a dashboard was created using Excel. The dashboard included key metrics such as total hours worked, total number of packaged and checked items, and total pay earned after taxes. The dashboard allowed for easy visualization of the data, enabling the end-user to quickly gain insights into the productivity and compensation of the workers.

### Conclusion
Overall, this project aimed to provide insights into the productivity and compensation of the workers at Samari Packaging Company. Through data cleaning, pivot table creation, and dashboard design, the project successfully analyzed and visualized the data. This project is an example of how data analysis can provide valuable insights into business operations, leading to better decision-making.
